# chatbot
This project implements a chatbot utilizing deep learning techniques with Keras. The chatbot is engineered to comprehend user intents from text inputs and produce pertinent responses, fostering conversational engagement for users.

This project is dedicated to crafting a chatbot utilizing Keras, a deep learning framework, to fabricate an interactive conversational agent. Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the chatbot adeptly grasps user intents from text inputs and crafts contextually relevant responses. The neural network model, architected with layers such as Embedding and LSTM, is trained using a dataset to discern patterns and refine response generation. The endeavor aims to enrich user interactions by furnishing personalized and precise responses, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience in chatbot-based applications. The seamless integration of the trained model into diverse platforms or applications facilitates effortless deployment and utilization of the chatbot's capabilities across varied use cases and domains.
